# Api Sandbox

_What is this repository about?_

Aside of having different repositories with repetitive projects related to api development/testing for different languages, i prefer to have a single one with my different studies explicited here. Down below you can check the desired structure for each language, considering also usage or not of frameworks.

After i gather a little more of front-end experience, it'll be also some front-end technologies also, mainly consuming the apis developed here.

- backend
    - language
        - native/framework 
- frontend
    - html/css
    - javascript
        - native/framework 
- infrastructure
    - _still not so sure, but something to get you up and running with fewer steps as possible_
