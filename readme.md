# Java Playground

_What is this repository about?_

This repository stores mainly some playful projects around Java, including trying to understand concepts, best practices, frameworks and libraries i'm interested in testing.

*repository structure:*
- root/
    - {framework/concept/etc}/
        - project/ 

...ideally every project have some kind of simplification for it to run ("./gradlew boot run" kind of instruction doesn't count). And also every project should have at least a readme explaining what the project's about.
