# That Simple Crud

_What is this all about?_

Actually, the title speaks for itself, instead of having one new repo on my github for each basic CRUD API i create in order to have a minimal understanding of a language, i'll have all of them stacked here in a simple file organization:

- backend
    - language

- frontend
    - html/css

- infrastructure
